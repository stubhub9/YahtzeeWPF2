# YahtzeeWPF2
Learning project for C#, WPF and Git ( and Entity, ASP, ... ).

Currently:
  Replacing GameDice with a Property heavy version with GameDie as a struct.
  Adding VisualModel and Visual Dice/ Die classes; for an upgraded diceBox.
  
Next, will probably be: 
  change method calls from the view to Async, 
  spinning the 2D dice for rolling, and other simple animations;
  better dice layout, held vs active;
  implementing row filters for enhanced (AI assisted) row or dice selection;
  mulligan/ cntrl Z;
  taking score with rolls remaining;
  Are you sure dialogs;
  AI  for 1 -3 players;
  list views, data templates;
  Bindings;
  3D dice, animated pencil;
  tablet and resize  support;
  more consideration for enums and dictionaries as documentation;
  IValueConverters;
  quick save;
  options dialog for colors and names.
  
 Possible Future:
  C# server/ XAML heavy client;
  More expression blend practice;
  Entity or other database ( histories, table mappings, other )
