# YahtzeeWPF2
## Learning project for C#, WPF and Git ( and Entity, ASP, ... ).

## Current tasks
  ### Update existing classes:  
      refactor long methods and classes:
        by chaining shorter methods;
        adding helper classes with tighter focus;
        better readability.
        
  ### Work on view models  ( M V VM ).
  
  ### Improve game play:
      implement dice filter and highlights; 
      begin AI reasoning, assistance, and players. 
  
#### Next, will probably be: 
  *  change method calls from the view to Async,  
    * spinning the 2D dice for rolling, and other simple animations; 
    better dice layout, held vs active; 
    implementing row filters for enhanced (AI assisted) row or dice selection;
       mulligan/ cntrl Z;
         taking score with rolls remaining;  
  Are you sure dialogs;
  AI  for 1 -3 players;
  list views, data templates;
  Bindings;
  3D dice, animated pencil;
  tablet and resize  support;
  more consideration for enums and dictionaries as documentation;
  IValueConverters;
  quick save;
  options dialog for colors and names.
  
 #### Possible Future:
  C# server/ XAML heavy client;
  More expression blend practice;
  Entity or other database ( advisories from histories, other )
