It works; could be better.
Next task one:  Remake to a generic, unlicensed dice game.

## Fan Tribute:  A Learning project for C#, WPF and Git and whatever I'm learning next. 
Next Iterations:
Maybe AI  (or at least ODDS):  ( with ADO, Entity, ... )
Maybe Server/ Client  (ASP, ... ).

< Someday, maybe >
## Current tasks: Make all classes read like GameScoring1!
???<maybe, it has been awhile>???

  ### Update existing classes:  
      refactor long methods and classes:
        by chaining shorter methods;
        adding helper classes with tighter focus;
        better readability.
        
  ### Work on view models  ( M V VM ).
  <mvc?>
  
  ### Improve game play:
      implement dice filter and highlights; 
      begin AI reasoning, assistance, and players. 
  
#### Next, will probably be: 
  *  change method calls from the view to Async;  
     spinning the 2D dice for rolling, and other simple animations;  
   better dice layout, held vs active;   
      implementing row filters for enhanced (AI assisted) row or dice selection;  
       mulligan/ cntrl Z;
         taking score with rolls remaining;  
  Are you sure dialogs;  
  AI  for 1 -3 players;  
  list views, data templates;  
  Bindings;  
  3D dice, animated pencil;  
  tablet and resize  support;  
  more consideration for enums and dictionaries as documentation;  
  IValueConverters;  
  quick save;  
  options dialog for colors and names.
  
 #### Possible Future:
   * C# server/ XAML heavy client;  
  More expression blend practice;  
  Entity or other database ( advisories from histories, other )
